Broad crypto weakness persists as macro stress indicators hold at elevated levels with USD/JPY at 156.04 and JGB 10Y at 2.24%.",
  "thesis_pulse": "XRP ETF total AUM has pulled back to $1.184B from ~$1.2B as price declined 4.2%, though weekly net inflows of $4.65M remain positive — institutional accumulation continues despite drawdown. RLUSD circulation advanced to $1.564B (31.3% of $5B target), a meaningful gain from the ~$1B baseline. JGB 10Y yields at 2.24% remain deep in critical territory (>2%), representing the most dangerous macro variable for the thesis. The PermissionedDEX amendment went live Feb 20 but zero institutional adoption data exists — this kill switch needs urgent monitoring as Q3 deadline approaches.",

Only Brent crude at $71.90 remains below elevated threshold. Score ticks up from 80 to 82 as F&G deteriorated further from 11 to 13 while JGB yields held at crisis levels."

Base and bull unchanged — institutional infrastructure buildout (RLUSD growth, ETF flows, PermissionedDEX live) still supports structural thesis."

The two critical blind spots — ODL volume and institutional DEX adoption — remain at zero data with Q3 deadlines approaching. XRP at $1.38 in an F&G 13 environment means the market is stress-testing the thesis; if institutional flows hold through this drawdown, it's constructive.

XRP's price is declining in an extreme fear environment where tech sector layoffs (Block -50%) and supply chain crises (IDC memory shortage) signal broader economic deterioration that could delay institutional crypto adoption timelines by quarters, not weeks. BIS Project Nexus remains the existential competitor — if central banks can achieve interoperable settlement through sovereign-backed infrastructure, the private-ledger bridge currency thesis becomes structurally redundant regardless of how much infrastructure Ripple builds."
