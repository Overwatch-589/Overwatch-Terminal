Compounding chains — particularly the ODL pivot → stablecoin cannibalization → narrative collapse chain — warrant an additional +5 for systemic risk. Macro conditions (F&G at 11, broad ETF outflows, Japan yield crisis) add another +3 since they've worsened since last assessment. Partially offset by -3 for XRP ETF flow divergence and RLUSD growth as a Ripple-ecosystem positive even if not directly XRP-positive. Net: 33 + 29 = 62.

Combined with $1.86M total XRPL DEX depth (institutionally irrelevant), zero Permissioned Domain adoption, and a thesis scoring system that rates infrastructure 'ACCELERATING' while every measurable kill switch shows null or sub-30% progress, the foundation of the investment thesis is contradicted by its own data. REDUCE EXPOSURE until Ripple publicly reaffirms ODL strategy with verifiable volume data, or until XRPL DEX depth reaches institutional-grade levels."
