    "description": "Nexus connects instant payment systems across jurisdictions with central bank endorsement. If Nexus achieves production corridors (targeting 2026-2027), it provides sovereign-grade FX settlement without bridge assets. Central banks will default to BIS infrastructure over private ledgers. XRPL's bridge currency thesis becomes structurally unnecessary for the exact high-value institutional corridors Ripple targets. Nexus doesn't need XRP, RLUSD, or any crypto intermediary — it settles in domestic fiat natively.",

    "description": "Circle is building institutional cross-border settlement directly on USDC rails with native CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) — no bridge asset needed. Banks can hold USDC, transfer across chains instantly, and off-ramp to fiat. This eliminates the two-hop friction that XRP's bridge function was designed to solve. With $60B+ USDC circulation and Coinbase/BlackRock backing, USDC has more institutional trust than RLUSD at $1.5B. If stablecoin-to-stablecoin settlement wins, XRP as bridge is redundant.",

Ripple stopped publicly reporting ODL metrics after rebranding to Ripple Payments. If volume were growing impressively, there would be commercial incentive to publish it.

If BRICS+ nations adopt CBDC interop for oil and trade settlement, the highest-volume cross-border corridors (China-Middle East, China-ASEAN) bypass crypto entirely.

Your own x402 agent demonstrates this — it pays in XRP drops, but the broader AI economy is standardizing on USDC/USDT on Ethereum/Base/Solana.
