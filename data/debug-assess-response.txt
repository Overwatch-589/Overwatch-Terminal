The ETF exit liquidity reframing undermines the second major bull pillar. Two of five existing kill switches are in DANGER status with no path to resolution. Eight new blind spots identified, seven recommended for permanent monitoring. The compounding risk chains show three critical-severity cascades. The bias check reveals a 7:16 bull:bear ratio with thesis scores inflated by unverifiable claims. The macro environment (F&G 11, BTC/ETH outflows of $163M, JGB crisis) provides no safety net.

(3) ETF exit liquidity reframing — 98% NAV-driven AUM undermines institutional adoption narrative (+4). (4) Permissioned domain liquidity fragmentation — structural flaw in key infrastructure feature (+2). (5) Japan BOJ crisis directly threatening strongest geographic pillar (+2). Score held below 60 because: regulatory clarity remains intact, no kill switches have formally triggered, XRP price showed resilience (+2.5% in extreme fear), and competing infrastructure is medium-term not immediate. The score reflects that the thesis is now challenged on utility (ODL void), infrastructure (liquidity fragmentation), institutional adoption (ETF as exit liquidity), and product strategy (RLUSD cannibalization) simultaneously — a qualitative deterioration that the previous score did not capture.",
