The central claim (institutional settlement volume) has zero verifiable data. Extreme Fear at 14 despite confirmed catalysts signals structural demand failure.

The score would be higher but is moderated by: confirmed regulatory status, confirmed ETF existence (even if unproven), and the medium-term (not immediate) timeline for CBDC and AI threats. Score reflects a thesis under serious multi-vector pressure with eroding foundational assumptions and no verifiable usage data to defend against.",

Simultaneously, zero verifiable ODL volume data, 40x USDC competitive dominance, advancing CBDC interop layers, and extreme fear at 14 despite confirmed catalysts collectively indicate the institutional demand narrative lacks evidentiary support. REDUCE EXPOSURE — maintain a monitoring position for ETF launch flow data and Q3 ODL disclosures, but the burden of proof has shifted decisively to the bull case."
