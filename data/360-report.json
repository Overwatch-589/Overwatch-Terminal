(3) Seven previously untracked blind spots have been identified, including two critical threats (stablecoin interop commoditization and CBDC bypass) that directly attack the core bridge asset thesis. The compounding risk chain of ODL opacity + stablecoin commoditization + RLUSD cannibalization is thesis-level critical. No single finding triggers EXIT_SIGNAL, but the combination of a triggered macro kill switch, three null demand metrics, and multiple newly-discovered critical threats exceeds the threshold for INCREASE_MONITORING and enters REDUCE_EXPOSURE territory.

Score would be higher but is held in check by confirmed regulatory clarity, institutional custody infrastructure strength, and RLUSD growth trajectory at 30% of target.

The Fear & Greed kill switch has triggered at 14 with JPY carry unwind risk compounding, and the newly discovered RLUSD cannibalization paradox means Ripple's own success may structurally decouple from XRP token demand. Recommendation is REDUCE_EXPOSURE — partial de-risk immediately, resolve data gaps on ODL and ETF flows before re-entering full position."
