Mid case reduced slightly from 38% to 35% due to macro headwinds suppressing institutional deployment timelines. Bull case down 1 point — the macro environment is hostile to the conditions needed for bull-case acceleration. Net shift: slightly more cautious. If JGB breaches 2.3% and holds, further bear/base reweighting warranted."

Price at $1.32 with Extreme Fear of 11 during peak catalyst convergence — ETF confirmed, regulation clear, custody strong — is the market telling you the catalysts have failed to translate into demand.
