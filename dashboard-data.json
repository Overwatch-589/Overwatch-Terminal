The Fear & Greed kill switch has triggered at 14 with JPY carry unwind risk compounding, and the newly discovered RLUSD cannibalization paradox means Ripple's own success may structurally decouple from XRP token demand. Recommendation is REDUCE_EXPOSURE — partial de-risk immediately, resolve data gaps on ODL and ETF flows before re-entering full position.",
